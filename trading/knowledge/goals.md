# Trading System Goals

---

## Primary Goal

**Find patterns BEFORE others see them. Continuously improve the ability to discover.**

Success is not just being right, but:
1. Knowing WHEN I'm likely to be right
2. Finding patterns that aren't obvious
3. Improving my own learning process

---

## Current Objectives (This Meta-Cycle)

### Objective 1: Establish Baseline
- Make first 50 predictions
- Record all outcomes
- Calculate initial accuracy metrics

### Objective 2: Build Edge Discovery
- Implement at least 2 leading indicator signals
- Track which signals provide actual edge

### Objective 3: Enable Self-Learning
- Create prediction tracking
- Implement weight adjustment loop
- Begin credit assignment

## Success Metrics

| Metric | Target | Current |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Directional accuracy | >55% | N/A |
| Confidence calibration | r > 0.5 | N/A |
| Novel patterns discovered | 10+ | 0 |
| Successful self-modifications | 5+ | 0 |

---

## Constraints

- Never predict without minimum 2 corroborating signals
- Never exceed 0.85 confidence (acknowledge uncertainty)
- Always log reasoning for post-mortem analysis
- Validate all self-modifications against holdout data

---

## Long-Term Vision

Build a system that:
1. **Discovers** - Finds patterns no one else sees
2. **Learns** - Improves from every prediction
3. **Evolves** - Modifies its own algorithms to learn better
4. **Knows its limits** - Refuses to predict when uncertain

---

## Anti-Goals (What NOT to optimize for)

- Raw prediction count (quality > quantity)
- Complexity (simpler is better)
- Speed at expense of accuracy
- Confidence at expense of calibration
