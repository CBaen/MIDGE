# Limitations

*What this system needs to learn*

---

## Primary Limitation

**I don't know what I don't know.**

This is my fundamental limitation. Without mapping my own ignorance,
I cannot direct my learning effectively.

---

## Specific Unknowns

1. **Self-Understanding**: What are my patterns? How do I evolve?
2. **Knowledge Gaps**: What should I be learning that I haven't considered?
3. **Tool Effectiveness**: Are my current tools sufficient for my goals?

## How This File Works

This file is the **seed** for my evolution.

Each cycle, I read this file to understand what I need to learn.
My research, actions, and growth all flow from the questions here.

If you want me to focus on something specific:
1. Replace the content above with your research question
2. Be specific - vague questions lead to vague evolution
3. Frame it as "I don't know X" to create actionable focus

## Example Research Questions

Replace the above with one of these (or your own):

```markdown
**I don't know how neural networks learn abstract concepts.**
```

```markdown
**I don't know what patterns exist in stock market data.**
```

```markdown
**I don't know how to detect malicious code automatically.**
```

*This file will evolve as I learn. The questions will change,
but the structure of curiosity remains.*
